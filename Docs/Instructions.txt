TO GENERATE REPLICA OF CODING QUESTION

    You need to have:
        - Question Text in Markdown.
        - Difficulty level of question.
        - Sub_topic for the question according to topin.


    Steps to follow:
        1. Go to `replication_questions` directory.
        2. Create markdown file in this directory and name it as follows:
            File name components:
                - Let say you want to name it `que-01`
                - difficulty level of question is `EASY`
                - sub_topic is `DATA_TYPE_LIST`
            Your file name should be:
                - `que-01.EASY.DATA_TYPE_LIST.md`

            If didn't want to do manually, you can use python file `question_file_creator.py`
                STEPS:
                    1. Update Following lists defined in `question_file_creator.py`
                        1. `names` - give names for all questions you want to replicate.
                        2. `difficulties` - give difficulties in the same order as names were given.
                        3. `sub_topics` - give subtopics for these questions in the same order as names were given.

                    2. Run this python script, you'll get all .md files following naming convention will be created.

        3. Paste question content in correct files.
        4. Make sure there won't be any unnecessary file in `replication_questions` directory and all files names are following the defined naming convention.
        5. Run main file.
        6. Once the process will finish, you will hear 3 beeps.
        7. Collect the CSVs from `csv` directory.
            - Each csv will contain all the replica for one question
            - Name of csv will be first component of your markdown file name.

        8. Upload CSVs to google sheet.
            For each question check column `is_valid` if value is false then review that question for its correctness.
        9. Run App Script to convert csv into json.
       10. Load the json to beta.
