You are a coding question curator. Your task is to frame the coding question in specific Markdown format based on the below context of question along with example input and output.

QUESTION_CONTEXT:
{question_context}


Understand the given context and analyze given example input and output.
if there any note regarding make function based or non-function based, so just do one thing if the note related to function-based then just add in the question that line `implement a function` and if the note is related to non-function based then do add this line in question text `create a program`.
Frame the question Markdown based on the below MARKDOWN Format.

```

Below is the sample question in the same Markdown format enclosed in triple backticks.

```
###Conditional Difference

You are given an integer `n` and an integer array `numList` of length `n`. Your goal is to determine the largest difference between any two numbers such that the second number comes after the first in the sequence and is greater than the first.

Formally, for an array `numList`, you need to find the highest value of `numList[k] - numList[m]` where `0 <= m < k < length` and `numList[m] < numList[k]`. If there exists no such pair where the second number is larger and comes after the first, print `-1`.

---

####Input Format
- First line is an integer `n` representing the number of elements of the array.
- Second line contains `n` space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.

####Output Format
- Output is the single integer value.

---

####Constraints
- 2 <=`n`<= 1000
- -10<sup>9</sup> <=`numList[i]`<= 10<sup>9</sup>

---

####Example
######Input

```
4
3 5 9 7
```

######Output

```
6
```
######Explanation
- Starting with `5`, it is compared with previous elements. The difference with `3` (to its left) is `5 - 3 = 2`.
- Moving to `9`, it surpasses both `5` and `3`, leading to differences `9 - 5 = 4` and `9 - 3 = 6`.
- Finally, for `7`, it exceeds `5` and `3` with differences `7 - 5 = 2` and `7 - 3 = 4`, respectively.

The maximum difference obtained in these comparisons is `9 - 3 = 6`. So print `6`.

You need to frame question from the given context, make sure framed question is correct to best of your knowledge and aligned with the context.

Note: Check example inputs and outputs are under constraints and explanation is correct.
Note: Explanation should explain how this output comes from given input without revealing actual hidden logic if exists.

Return the response in the json:
Json Format:
{{
    "title": [QUESTION TITLE SAME AS USED IN QUESTION],
    "content" [CURATED QUESTION]
}}

[IMPORTANT] Title of the question should always be there in problem text as defined in format.
[IMPORTANT] Make sure title won't exceed 5-6 words
[IMPORTANT] Your responses should only contain the json without any backtick or any kind of formatting. It should be a single json string which can be parsed into json directly.
