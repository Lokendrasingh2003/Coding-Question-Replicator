---

#### Input Format
- An integer `n` representing the number of natural numbers for which squares are to be generated.

#### Output Format
- `n` space-separated integers representing the squares of the first `n` natural numbers.

---

#### Constraints
- 1 <= `n` <= 1000

---

#### Example 1
###### Input
    5

###### Output
    1 4 9 16 25
